Ben Holman Assignment 1:


COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:

each directory contains one makefile. 

run the 'make' command in the terminal to generate the object files and executable

run the 'make clean' command to remove the object and executable files.

these programs were written and compiled using the Ubuntu gcc compiler version 12.3.0

ISSUES:

the repsository would not clone to the wasp server via HTTPS with the PAT or through SSH. I had to upload the files to the repo via the 'Add Files' on the repo's website UI.
