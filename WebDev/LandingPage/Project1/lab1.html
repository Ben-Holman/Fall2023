            In Lab 1,we were given the ability to create our own page using HTML. This page was about someone sharing their photos of New York's central park. The lab was a big help 
            in understanding the basic structure of a HTML page. How the tags works, and what the tags can do and change on the screen. Through the lab, one of the things I learned
            is that HTML tags are case-insensitive. If you would like to see the lab at each step, click <a href = "../Lab03_Holman/index.html">here for Part 1</a> and <a href = "../Lab03P2_Holman/index.html">for Part 2</a>.
