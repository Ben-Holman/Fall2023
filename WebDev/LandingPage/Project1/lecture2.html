        <h2>The Internet: A Complex Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>In Lecture 2, we learn about the history of the internet from it's <strong>Cold War</strong> beginnings to today's complex web of <strong>services</strong> and <strong>web applications</strong>.
        The ARPANET, created in the 1960's gave rise to the early internet through the use of packet switching and protocols. Then Sr. Tim Berners-Lee, in 1992, sets the standards for the World Wide Web(WWW).
        The <strong>Uniform Resource Locator(URL)</strong> gives each webpage a unique ID to be searched out on the web. 
        The <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong> is used for request handling from client to server and vice versa.
        The <strong>Web Server Software</strong> is software that is designed specifically to handle HTTP requests.
        The <strong>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</strong> is the programming language used to create and publish pages and documents on the web. This web page was created using HTML!
        Finally, you need something to interpret HTTP, URLs and HTML, and that is the browser. <strong>Edge, FireFox, Chrome, and Safari</strong> are all different browsers.

        <h2>Web 2.0</h2>
        <p>The introduction of <strong>Javascript</strong> gave web developers the tools to create more interactive webpages and through that, create a more user-driven experience. 
           Web 2.0 focused heavily on browser use and relying less on the server to deliever dynamic web content. This broswer-focused development meant that web developers
           needed to learn Javascript.
