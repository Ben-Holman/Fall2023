        <h2>Where Is The Internet?</h2>
        <p>In Lecture 2, we learn that the internet is all around us, it's like the Force, but we can see it. The internet is comprised of millions, potentially billions, of copper and fiber optic wires that
            are connected to servers, computers, routers, modems etc. These wires are the "Information Super Highway" that the data being sent and recieved move on. 
        </p>
        <h4>Hardware:</h4>
        <p>The hardware required to access the internet is normally a <strong>broadband modem</strong> that you can either buy yourself, or get provided by your <strong>Internet Service Provider(ISP)</strong> like AT&T or Spectrum and more.
            the modem is the key to transfer and recieve data to and from the outside world. A <strong>wireless router</strong> is a device that normally connects to the modem(there are router modem combinations).
            the router's job is to transfer packets of data from network to another. a Device can typically access the internet by either wiring into the router directly with an <strong>ethernet</strong>
            cable or have a WiFi ard installed on the motherboard to access the router wirelessly. 
        </p>
        <h4>How The Internet Is Organized:</h4>
        <p>
            The internet is comprised of different Tiers. Tier 2 is regional networks that are smaller and have worse performance than Tier 1 networks. Tier 1 networks are what as
            referred to as "internet backbones." These networks are comprised of fast fiber optic cables and cover a longer distance than regional networks. 
            These backbones cover from one region to another or more and are composed and run through multiple ISPs.

        <h2>Different Web Development Positions:</h2>
        <p>
            The Web has created a lot of jobs since it's inception.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware Architect</li>
                <li>Network Architect</li>
                <li>Databases Admin/Designer</li>
                <li>Security</li>
                <li>UI/UX</li>
                <li>Front and Back end developers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            and so many more. And the Web has not only created multiple jobs, but also multiple new companies to handle the infrastructure of the modern internet. 
            From hosting companies to start-ups, cybersecurity and migration companies. The internet is it's own ecosystem that has created the need for companies like these for better or worse.
