        <p>Lecture 1 is all about the class itself! The Lecture talks the general overview of the class, goes over the Syllabus, class expectations, and important dates among other things.
            The class is all online, but has a meet-time once a week on Tuesday from 4:00 PM - 5:15 PM. The class is taught by Professor Angela Guercio. This class is part 1 of a 2 part course 
            that is from the basics of web programming to backend/sever-side programming and advanced scripting with Javascript.
